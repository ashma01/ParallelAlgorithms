  - This will give the results for the sequential and parallel implementations of the MST algorithms
  - To run the benchmark, run the AlgorithmBenchmark.java.
  - This will store the benchmark results in a file with prefix jmh-result.csv
  - To generate the input graph you may use the attached python script.
